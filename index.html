Hello World, Before you get to into my blog, let me introduce myself. My name is Mary Katharine Butler, but I have gone by Kati my whole life. I am currently a 21 year old, Junior at Saint Josephâ€™s University and this blog is part of my Communications 200 class. I am a Communications major looking to double minor  in Entertainment Marketing and PR and Advertising. At Saint Joseph's University, I am a sister of Alpha Omicron Pi and a Transfer mentor. After graduating Saint Joseph's University. I would love to either work at a PR company or Event Planning company in the Entertainment world or open a PR company with my sister or be part of the Elvis Duran Morning Show.
I have created this blog to not only broaden my taste in music but yours as well. I have listened to all genres in my 21 years, but have stayed loyal to pop music and country music. With this blog I want to introduce different artist you may know very well or unknown to you.
