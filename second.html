<p>I have created this blog to not only broaden my taste in music but yours as well. I have listened to all genres in my 21 years, but have stayed loyal to pop music and country music. With this blog I want to introduce different artist you may know very well or unknown to you.</p>
<p>Monday : Country Music</p>
<p>Friday:Pop Music</p>

<p>With each post, I will introduce an artist or a band, have a playlist of their songs, a review on a new album release, a concert review, finding the meaning/story of a song and more. If you are interested in these types of topics please subscribe!<p>
<p>Favorite Artists: Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Tori Kelly, Nick Jonas, Luke Bryan, Sam Hunt</p>
<p>Favorite Bands: Little Mix, Dan and Shay, Alex and Sierra</p>
